## Advent of Code 2021.
Writing all this so I don't forget, if it helps someone else great. Here are the steps
1. Follow this [resource](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1) on how  to get your cookie session 
2. Save the session key in a session.txt file. Make sure you do not commit this file to your github as it contains a secret. 
3. Modify the code in get_input.py ([copied from](https://github.com/coreone/aoc-2021/blob/main/get.py) and modified) so you can get your input each day. 
4. Run the script with the command (e.g get_input -d 2 to get day 2 input)
``` 
get_input -d <day> 
```
5. Go code away and get the solutions submitted.
**Note**: The day inputs are downloaded in the path from which you run the code as input_day{day}.txt (e.g input_day2.txt)

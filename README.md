## Advent of Code 2021.
Writing all this so I don't forget, if it helps someone else great. Here are the steps
1. Follow this [resource](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1) on how  to get your AOC cookie session key
2. Save the session key in a session.txt file. Make sure you do not commit this file to your github as it contains a secret. 
3. Modify the code in get_input.py ([copied from Tex](https://github.com/coreone/aoc-2021/blob/main/get.py) and modified) so you can get your input each day. 
4. Run the script with the command (e.g get_input -d 2 -y 2021 to get day 2 input of event 2021)
``` 
get_input -d <day> -y year
```
5. Go code away and get the solutions submitted.\
\
**Note**: The day inputs are downloaded in the path from which you run the code as year/input_day{day}.txt (e.g 2021/nput_day2.txt). It creates the year dir if it does not already exist.
